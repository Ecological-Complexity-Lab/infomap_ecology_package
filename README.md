## infomapecology: A package for running Infomap, inspired by ecological networks

The package contains functions that prepare monolayer and multilayer networks
for analysis with Infomap, run Infomap from within R and parse the results
back to R. It is inspired by analysis of ecological networks but is
suitable for other areas of research as well. The package also includes several data sets of ecological networks.
