## :wave: About
**This repository contains the code for the R package infomapecology.** infomapecology is an R package with functions that prepare monolayer and multilayer networks for analysis with Infomap, run Infomap from within R and parse the results back to R. It is inspired by analysis of ecological networks but is suitable for other areas of research as well.
