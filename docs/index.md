This is the technical extension of the paper _A dynamical perspective to community detection in ecological networks_. We detail here the Infomap commands and R code that we use in the examples that are presented in the paper. In this page we present some general functions and Infomap arguments that are relevant for all the examples. Then for each example in the paper we have a separate Wiki page here, which includes the Infomap commands and R code relevant to reproduce the example. 

* The full R code including the code used to produce plots as well as the data sets, can be found in this repository in the file `infomap_ecology_main.R`.
* We have created the R package [infomapecology](https://github.com/Ecological-Complexity-Lab/infomap_ecology_package) to facilitate the use of Infomap with R. **However, in this Wiki we still specify the arguments that go into Infomap's standalone file.**
* Infomap's standalone can also be run online [here](https://www.mapequation.org/infomap/).

# Installation of Infomap and infomapecology
Install Infomap and infomapecology as specified in the <a href="https://ecological-complexity-lab.github.io/infomap_ecology_package/installation">installation instructions.
 
# Basics
