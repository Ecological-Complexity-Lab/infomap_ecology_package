#'infomapecology: A package for running Infomap, inspired by ecological networks
#'
#'The package contains functions that prepare monolayer and multilayer networks
#'for analysis with Infomap, run Infomap from within R and parse the results
#'back to R. Also includes standardized objects to store and further analyze
#'monolayer and multilayer networks. The package is inspired by analysis of
#'ecological networks but is suitable for other areas of research as well.
#'
#'We use Infomap version 1 as a stand-alone file. Future versions (or a differen
#'package) will integrate Infomap directly intro R. Complete instructions on how
#'to download, install and use Infomap can be found in
#'\href{https://www.mapequation.org}{https://www.mapequation.org}. The best
#'practice is to compile Infomap under the file name Infomap and place it in the
#'same working folder in which the R code is run.
#'
#'The package also includes several data sets of ecological networks.
#'
#'Ideas/requests for features are welcome (open an issue \href{here}{https://github.com/Ecological-Complexity-Lab/infomap_ecology_package/issues}).
