This site is an extension of the paper [Identifying flow modules in ecological networks using Infomap](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13569) It contains installation instructions and very detailed Infomap commands and R code that we use in the examples that are presented in the paper. Infomap is a very rich implementation of the map equation, fully covered in [https://www.mapequation.org/](https://www.mapequation.org/). In this knowledge base we present what is most relevant for ecological network analysis and the R package `infomapecology`. The package is a convenient interface to use Infomap within R. We will be updating this knowledge base with every improvement of `infomapecology`.

# Installation of Infomap and infomapecology
Currently, infomapecology uses a standalone version of Infomap. We are working hard to integrate Infomap directly into R. Until that happens, install Infomap and infomapecology as specified [here](https://ecological-complexity-lab.github.io/infomap_ecology_package/installation).
 
# Infomap's basics
The basics of Infomap's input and output are [here](https://ecological-complexity-lab.github.io/infomap_ecology_package/infomapbasics).
